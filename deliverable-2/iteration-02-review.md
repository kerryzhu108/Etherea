 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

Using Trello was a successful process-related decision. Trello was useful because it allows any team member to see what everyone else is working on. It outlines all of the tasks that need to be completed in the project and a brief description of what each task entails. The reason this decision is considered to be successful is because there were never situations in which team members had to ask one another what task they were working on. We already knew what each other was working on. 

Using Instagram was also a successful process-related decision. Instagram allows us to communicate quickly and get clarification on certain aspects that we were confused by that descriptions on Trello couldn't clear up. For example, one of us encountered a bug in the program and by using Instagram, the other group members were able to quickly communicate about potential solutions that allowed the problem to get cleared up quickly. 

Always asking questions was a successful process-related decision. More specifically, asking questions when there was any type of misunderstanding, miscommunication, or there was something that a team member didn't understand. The purpose of asking questions under these circumstances was to ensure that everyone was on the same page and someone wasn't going to work on something with the wrong idea. This was a successful decision because there were no situations in which someone completed something and the other group members had no idea what they were trying to do. 

Communicating more casually was a successful process-related decision. Working on the project for long periods of time is draining and could cause morale to go down. We talked about aspects of the project on Instagram, but we also talked about things related to other courses and not everything in the group chat was extremely serious nor did it have to be. This type of discussion didn't dominate the group chat, but it did increase morale and made people feel less stressed. 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

A process-related decision that was not as successful as we thought it would be was the meetings. We planned to meet on Google Meet for some of the weeks, but we never found a need to. We also didn't meet with the partner very often because for this deliverable, everything was extremely clear. There was no purpose in meeting because everyone knew what they had to do for the deliverable. Anything that we needed to communicate with each other was done through Instagram.

Another process-related decision that was not as successful as we thought it would be was the in-person tutorials. They were successful in team building and getting to know each other better, but they weren't extremely necessary for team organization. We asked questions about the project to the TA, but all other communication was mainly done on Instagram. 

A process-related decision that was not as successful as we thought it would be was dealing with members who didn't contribute and dealing with conflicts. The reason we consider these decisions unsuccessful was because these circumstances never arose. There were never situations in which there were severe conflicts to the point where other members had to step in. There were also no situations in which someone didn't complete something they said they would.


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

We are not planning on making many changes to our process, even to those we deemed as unsuccessful. We deemed things unsuccessful if the process was never implemented or we weren't able to get the full benefit of it. We believe that after this deliverable, we will meet more often on Google Meet because there we believe that certain features will become more complicated and clarification will be required. Because of this, we will also find in-person tutorials more useful. Nothing related to communication has to change because there were very few issues with the way we were communicating and the platforms we chose to do them on. 

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
How did you prepare your demo?

* Went through the features we a mock account, demoed to partner via sharing screens on mobile, each person explained the features they had been responsible for.

What did you manage to demo to your partner?

* We demoed the Login in and Sign up validations, selecting monthly tasks as new user, checking off tasks every day, the user's changing impact statistics, and the global leaderboard of the most impactful users.

Did your partner accept the features?

* Yes, they had no major issues with existing feature.

Were there change requests?

* The only changes requested were UI tweaks such as having the daily tasks display a checkmark instead of dissapear, and also additional infographics to display when the users select their tasks, and display points for the tasks after a user has chosen them.

What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

* Sometimes a feature that took a lot of work does not seem very impressive over demo. Like the sign up and login functionality. Client/customors are more impressed by good looking UI. Going through the demo with a brand new account on different phones is also an important process to catch unexpected bugs.  

* *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
